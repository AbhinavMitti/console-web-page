        Web developers often log messages to the Console to make sure that their JavaScript is working as expected. To
        log a message, you insert an expression like console.log('Hello, Console!') into your JavaScript. When the
        browser executes your JavaScript and sees an expression like that, it knows that it's supposed to log the
        message to the Console. And it is also used for checking errors on your coding which helps a lot.
